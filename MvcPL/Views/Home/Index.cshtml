<h2>Dressage</h2>

<p>
    Dressage is a competitive equestrian sport, defined by the International Equestrian Federation as
    "the highest expression of horse training", where "horse and rider are expected to perform
    from memory a series of predetermined movements." Competitions are held at all levels
    from amateur to the World Equestrian Games. Its fundamental purpose is to develop, through
    standardized progressive training methods, a horse's natural athletic ability and willingness
    to perform, thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse. At the peak of a dressage horse's
    gymnastic development, the horse will respond smoothly to a skilled rider's minimal aids.
    The rider will be relaxed and appear effort-free while the horse willingly performs the requested
    movement. Dressage is occasionally referred to as "Horse Ballet." Although the discipline has ancient 
    roots in Europe, dressage was first recognized as an important equestrian pursuit during the Renaissance. 
    The great European riding masters of that period developed a sequential training system that has changed 
    little since then. Classical dressage is still considered the basis of modern dressage.

<p>In modern dressage competition, successful training at the various levels is demonstrated through the
     performance of "tests", prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena. Judges evaluate
     each movement on the basis of an objective standard appropriate to the level of the test and assign 
    each movement a score from zero to ten – zero being "not executed" and 10 being "excellent". 
    A score of 9 is very good and is a high mark, while a competitor achieving all 6s (or 60% overall) 
    should be considering moving on to the next level.</p>
